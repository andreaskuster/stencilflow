\chapter{Evaluation of XYZ in Hardware}


\section{Introduction}
TODO: Write what we want to measure and what we expect.


\section{Single Stencils}
Comment: Great, I like the division into simple stencils and the COSMO programs.

\subsection{Jacobi2D}
TODO: Show basic graphs, and performance data for different sizes (16x16 -> 32768x32768)

\subsection{Jacobi3D}
TODO: Show basic graphs, and performance data for different sizes (16x16x16 -> 1024x1024x1024)


\section{COSMO Stencil Chains}
Comments: I think we don't want to use the word "chains", since this implies that it's a linear sequence, which is not true

\subsection{Fastwaves}
TODO: Show basic graphs, and performance data for different sizes (16x16x16 -> 1024x1024x1024)

\subsection{Advection}
TODO: Show basic graphs, and performance data for different sizes (16x16x16 -> 1024x1024x1024)

\subsection{Diffusion}
TODO: Show basic graphs, and performance data for different sizes (16x16x16 -> 1024x1024x1024)


\section{Conclusion}
TODO: Write down the findings from the examples.
